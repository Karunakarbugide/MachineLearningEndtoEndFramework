An end-to-end machine learning using Pydash

For any Machine Learning projects following are the 8 main steps one should go through. 

 1. Frame the Problem statement and look aat the big picture
 2. Get the data
 3. Discover and visulize the data to gain insights
 4. Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms
 5. Explore many different models and  shortlist the best ones
 6. Fine tune the models and combine then in to the greater solution
 7. Present the Solution
 8. Launch , monitor and maintain
